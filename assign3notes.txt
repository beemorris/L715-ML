Assignment 3:
	- SVMs
	- Get all instances of the words in question and save them all as .txt files (< lexalt item = word>) --- this is training and test data
		- The answer isn't in the test data
		- Key file is y value for test
	- How are we representing our features?
		- Sparse vectors?
			- arm.n has like 266 something training examples
	- word2vec: we're gonna use this
		- we can import this
	- we'll have a vector for each of things and for the n-gram ones we'll have to figure out how this is gonna work pointwise something?

Steps:
	- read in XML file
	- then split on the XML tag
	- this will give us a list of eaach instance and each instance is matched to a single line in the keys file
	- then split on spaces and then getting the index of the word that starts with the head tag gives us a vector of the 2 words before and after
